Shop is designed in higly interactive manner. Customers may add products to the basket. Leave their money with us. And - last but not least - rate selected products using ***stars***!

To see which stars can be marked, once page is loaded open terminal and enter this command into console:
```
document.querySelectorAll('.stars a');
```
Yet this is a **perfect example** of undercover beauty as those stars will be represented as DOM elements. Yet remember, as very famous developer *Dan Salomon* once said:
> Sometimes it pays to stay in bed on Monday, rather than spending the rest of the week debugging Monday's code.

So please, just don't click everywhere yet. Work is under progress!
